cmusCoversSDL
-------------

About
---
Simple cover art viewer for cmus using SDL2 and SDL2_Image.
Instead of being a script that runs another image viewer, this program uses its own window. This allows it to work well with tiling window managers.

Compiling
---
`make`
You may want to edit config.h. It'll be copied from config.def.h the first time you run `make.`
If cmus-remote isn't in /usr/bin/cmus-remote, you must open `config.h` and modify the `programArgs` array.

libavformat
---
Embedded cover images are grabbed from audio files using libavformat, which is part of ffmpeg.
If you don't need this feature, you can disable it by editing the makefile. There are instructions located in it.

Tip
---
To force the program to check for song change, send SIGUSR1 to the program.
`pkill -USR1 cmusCoverViewer`
To make this automatically run when cmus updates, create a script with the command and tell cmus to use it with 
`:set status_display_program=/home/user/whateverscript.sh`
